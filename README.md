# Duckalog

Duckalog is a [Datalog][datalog] engine built on [DuckDB][duckdb].

Currently only usable as a Rust library; there is no parser.

It's like [Duckegg][duckegg], but the focus is on supporting semi-na√Øve
evaluation, rather than experimenting with e-graphs.

## Features

Almost none!

## Language

The language is 100% vanilla Datalog. There are no datatypes, no declaring
relations, no negation, no aggregation. Facts are part of the program, they
are simply rules with empty bodies.
